I am a software developer who loves creating simple solutions to complex problems. I have extensive skills in backend development and DevOps, and I am always looking to automate processes to speed up software delivery while writing scalable and maintainable code. I am constantly seeking new ways to learn and grow. Currently, I am focused on expanding my knowledge in architecture technologies, DevOps, and observability and reliability!
